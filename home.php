        <p class="home">Sichuan cuisine, Szechwan cuisine, 
            or Szechuan cuisine (四川菜) , alternatively known as Chuan cuisine, 
            is a style of Chinese cuisine originating from Sichuan Province in southwestern China.
        It has bold flavours, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use 
            of garlic and chili peppers, as well as the unique flavour of Sichuan pepper. 
        There are many local variations within Sichuan Province and the neighbouring Chongqing Municipality, 
            which was part of Sichuan Province until 1997.
        Four sub-styles of Sichuan cuisine include Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong and Buddhist 
            vegetarian style.</p>
        <p class="home">Sichuan in the Middle Ages welcomed Near Eastern crops, such as broad beans, sesame and walnuts. 
            Since the 16th century, the list of major crops in Sichuan has even been lengthened by New World newcomers. 
            The characteristic chili pepper came from Mexico, but probably overland from India or by river from Macao, 
            replacing the spicy peppers of ancient times[citation needed] and complementing the Sichuan peppercorn (花椒; huājiāo). 
            Other newcomers from the New World included maize (corn), which largely replaced millet; white potatoes introduced by Catholic missions; and sweet potatoes. 
            The population of Sichuan was cut by perhaps three quarters in the wars from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. 
            Settlers from the adjacent Hunan Province brought their cooking styles with them.</p>
        <p class="home">Sichuan is colloquially known as the "heavenly country" due to its abundance of food and natural resources. 
            One ancient Chinese account declared that the "people of Sichuan uphold good flavour, and they are fond of hot and spicy taste." 
            Most Sichuan dishes are spicy, although a typical meal includes non-spicy dishes to cool the palate. 
            Sichuan cuisine is composed of seven basic flavours: sour, pungent, hot, sweet, bitter, aromatic and salty. 
            Sichuan food is divided into five different types: sumptuous banquet, ordinary banquet, popularised food, household-style food and food snacks. 
            Milder versions of Sichuan dishes remain a staple of American Chinese cuisine.The complex topography of Sichuan Province, including its mountains, hills, plains, plateaus and the Sichuan Basin, has shaped its food customs with versatile and distinct ingredients.</p>

        <p class="home">Sichuan cuisine often contains food preserved through pickling, salting and drying. Preserved dishes are generally served as spicy dishes with heavy application of chili oil.
The most unique and important spice in Sichuan cuisine is the Sichuan pepper (花椒; huājiāo; "flower pepper"). Sichuan peppercorn has an intense fragrant, citrus-like flavour and produces a "tingly-numbing" (麻; má) sensation in the mouth. Other commonly used spices in Sichuan cuisine are garlic, chili peppers, ginger and star anise.
Broad bean chili paste (豆瓣酱; 豆瓣醬; dòubànjiàng) is one of the most important seasonings.It is an essential component to famous dishes such as Mapo tofu and double-cooked pork slices. Sichuan cuisine is the origin of several prominent sauces/flavours widely used in modern Chinese cuisine, including: Yuxiang (魚香); Mala (麻辣); Guaiwei (怪味). Common preparation techniques in Sichuan cuisine include stir frying, steaming and braising, but a complete list would include more than 20 distinct techniques. (Referenced from Wiki Pedia)
