                    <h4>Software Engineer - Backend | Java, SpringBoot, Redis, MySQL, Kafka</h4>
                    <p class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">Nov 2022 - Aug 2024</p>
                    <p>As the core engineer for Meituan's user growth campaign and payment system, I designed and built a high-performance architecture that handled 20M DAU 
                        with 50,000 peak QPS and a 99.999% response rate. I implemented comprehensive micro-service architecture using Java, SpringBoot, Redis, and Kafka, 
                        successfully splitting services and restructuring business logic that reduced TP90 response times from 230ms to 90ms and resolved 90% of legacy 
                        system issues. I engineered robust data optimization strategies including Redis caching, traffic splitting, and client-side caching that maintained 
                        TP99 business data processing under 20ms. My contributions to the user growth business line included building 20+ core features that increased DAU 
                        from 80K to 12M and raised user retention from 16% to 42%, while implementing disaster recovery solutions with Docker and Kubernetes that ensured 
                        RTO under 3 minutes.</p>
                    <h4>Software Engineer - Frontend | Java, Objective-C, Python, JavaScript, C++</h4>
                    <p class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">Aug 2020 - Nov 2022</p>
                    <p>The first software development work in my career. I made significant contributions to the MRN (Meituan React Native) and MSI 
                        (Meituan Standard API) frameworks, focusing on rendering and JS bridge functionality that served 100+ business units with 10B daily PVs 
                        at 99.9999% success and 0.003% crash rates. I led the development of an API management and monitoring system, creating data collection functions 
                        and Python scripts for Jenkins CI pipeline plugins that successfully prevented 10+ P0 (highest-level) issues in Q2 2022. I also built JS Bundle 
                        distribution capabilities using S3 object storage and CDN distribution, enabling businesses to achieve real-time content updates. My technical 
                        excellence and leadership in these critical infrastructure projects resulted in two promotions during this period.</p>
